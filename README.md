• Project background

Space X advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because Space X can reuse the first stage. Therefore, if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against space X for a rocket launch. This goal of the project is to create a machine learning pipeline to predict if the first stage will land successfully.

• Problems you want to find answers
- What factors determine if the rocket will land successfully?
- The interaction amongst various features that determine the success rate of a successful landing.
- What operating conditions needs to be in place to ensure a successful landing program.

## Conclusion

We can presume that: 
The bigger the flight sum at a send off site, the more noteworthy the achievement rate at a send off site.

Send off progress rate began to increment in 2013 till 2020. 

Circles ES-L1, GEO, HEO, SSO, VLEO had the most achievement rate.

KSC LC-39A had the best send-offs of any destinations.

The Best model is Decision tree for this project.
